PultEQFx
========

The easy way
------------
Run install.sh from this folder:

  ./install.sh              install for you
  ./install.sh --system     install for all users (run with sudo)

It copies both plugins into ~/.clap/BurningTreeC and ~/.vst3/BurningTreeC.

By hand
-------
CLAP   copy PultEQFx.clap to            ~/.clap
VST3   copy the PultEQFx.vst3 folder to ~/.vst3

For all users, use /usr/lib/clap and /usr/lib/vst3 instead. Create the
directory first if it does not exist. A per-vendor subfolder such as
~/.clap/BurningTreeC works too, and is what install.sh uses.

If your DAW does not list CLAP plugins, see
