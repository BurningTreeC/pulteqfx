PultEQFx
========

The easy way
------------
Double-click Install.command. It copies both plugins into place and clears the
macOS quarantine flag described below.

The first time, macOS will refuse to run it because it came from the internet.
Right-click Install.command, choose Open, then confirm in the dialog. After
that it runs normally.

By hand
-------
Copy the bundles (they are folders, copy the whole thing) to:

  CLAP   ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/PultEQFx.clap
  VST3   ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/PultEQFx.vst3

(Install.command puts them in a BurningTreeC subfolder of each, which hosts
search just the same.)

Then open Terminal and run:

  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/PultEQFx.clap
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/PultEQFx.vst3

Why that last step is needed
----------------------------
The plugins are signed, but only ad-hoc: signed by nobody in particular. That
is enough for macOS to load them, and on Apple Silicon it is required, but it
is not the same as being notarized by Apple. Notarizing needs a paid Apple
Developer account, which this project does not have.

macOS tags anything downloaded from the internet with a quarantine flag, and
refuses to load quarantined code that is not notarized. Removing the flag with
the command above tells macOS you trust these files. Nothing else about the
plugins changes.

Note that Logic and GarageBand only load Audio Units, and this plugin is CLAP
and VST3, so use a host that supports those.
