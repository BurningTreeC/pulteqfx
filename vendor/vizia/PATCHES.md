# Local Vizia integration changes

Upstream: vizia/vizia `426d2e7b8533d485e78ab7f07f9f81d8324c256d`
(manifest 0.4.0), inspected 2026-09-26.

The baseview backend is ported from baseview 0.2.2 to 0.3.4. It exposes the new
window creation/host/lifecycle API, preserves GL context ownership, and uses the
new native resize callbacks. Vsync remains disabled in the GL configuration;
baseview schedules frames.

Native events and resize callbacks are queued during reentry and drained in
order; nested drawing is skipped. Text-field focus controls the scoped Windows
text-input hook. User zoom is requested through native resize and committed
from the resulting size notification, including asynchronous Linux callbacks
and host rollback. `UserScaleChanged` and `WindowScaleChanged` notify the adapter
and the plugin of the resulting geometry.

`NamedKey` is re-exported from the input module for keyboard-types 0.8 callers.
The rendering/reactivity/layout engines are otherwise unchanged. PultEQFx's
own controls use upstream reactive signals and Skia drawing.

Vendored from GainStageFx's copy, unchanged; keep the two in step.
