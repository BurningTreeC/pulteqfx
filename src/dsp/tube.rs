//! The make-up amplifier.
//!
//! The passive EQ network throws away roughly 22 dB, which the EQP-1A's tube
//! amplifier puts back. That amplifier is the other half of the unit's
//! reputation: a push-pull triode stage into an output transformer, so it
//! contributes mostly odd order harmonics with a little second order from the
//! stage imbalance, plus the bandwidth limits of the iron at both ends.
//!
//! The stage itself is fixed, as the hardware's is: clean at the level the
//! unit is run at, and running gently out of headroom as the peaks approach
//! digital full scale. What it sounds like is decided by how hard it is hit.
//!
//! The `drive` control is the one liberty this plugin takes with the hardware,
//! and it does what hitting the hardware harder does: it raises the level into
//! the stage, so the sound gets louder and dirtier together, and the output
//! trim after it brings the level back. It used to be a saturation amount that
//! held quiet signals at the same level and squashed loud ones, which read as a
//! compressor that made things quieter the further it was turned up.
